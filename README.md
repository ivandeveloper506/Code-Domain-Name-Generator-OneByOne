# Code-Domain-Name-Generator

## The Domain Name Generator

Finding a domain name is hard, why not automate it? :)

## Installation
1. Start a new empty project.
2. Create one app.jsjavascript file.
3. Add your code inside your app.js file.
4. You have to use console.log("Any string");to show something on the console.
5. Run your code by typing: $ node app.js.

## Instructions

Create a script that generate all the possible domain name combinations from a list of pronouns, adjectives and nouns, for example:

let pronoun = ['the','our'];
let adj = ['great', 'big' ];
let noun = ['jogger','racoon'];

Should generate something like:

thegreatjogger.com
thegreatracoon.com
ourgreatjogger.com
ourgreatracoon.com
thebigjogger.com
thebigracoon.com
ourbigjogger.com
ourbigracoon.com

## Hint

You'll need to use nested for loops in order to mix the different values together.

Your tools: For loop, string concatenation.

## Feeling confident?
* Add several types of extensions: .com, .net, .us, .io, etc.
* Add domain hacks, for example: instead of lastOfUs.comyou can use the .usdomain like this: lastOf.us

## A bit of history about the project

Before the domain market was centralized and converted into a mafia controlled by Godaddy, Enom and some others. Normal people like you and me were able to buy a .com domain relatively easy.

In fact, this project was originally built in 2002 by one of 4Geeks teachers while he was trying to find domain names to buy for several projects.
